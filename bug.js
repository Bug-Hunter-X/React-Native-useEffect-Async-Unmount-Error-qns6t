This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside.  The problem arises when the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to a potential crash or unexpected behavior.  The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is not always sufficient to prevent this because the asynchronous operation might continue to run in the background even after the component is unmounted.  Consider this example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some-url');
    setData(await response.json());
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

If the component unmounts while `fetchData` is still in progress, you might get an error because `setData` is called after the component is no longer mounted.
