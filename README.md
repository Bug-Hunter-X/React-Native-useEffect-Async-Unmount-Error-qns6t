# React Native useEffect Async Unmount Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook and provides a solution to prevent it.  The problem arises when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation (like a network request) completes. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function isn't always enough to prevent issues because asynchronous operations can continue even after the component is unmounted.  This often results in errors related to updating state after the component has been unmounted.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `AbortController` API to cancel the asynchronous operation when the component unmounts. This ensures that no updates are attempted after the component is no longer in the DOM.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the example. You'll see the error demonstration and the solution implemented.
